This is a Pothole Detection App. 

You open the app and have two options.

Option A: Camera
   You take a picture of the pothole. The app detects that it is a pothole and saves the current location of the pothole.

Option B: Map
   You see all the potholes on the map. You can remove the pothole from the map.
